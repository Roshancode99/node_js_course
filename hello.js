console.log("hello node js");

//Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser.
// Normally, JavaScript runs in browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.), but Node.js lets you run it on your computer/server, which makes it powerful for backend development.
// It is event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous), which makes it very fast for I/O-heavy tasks (like APIs, databases, file operations).
